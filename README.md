The **Vaultbound Pouch** is a homebrew D&D 5e item designed to enhance gameplay by providing adventurers with a magical way to securely store their gold. This wondrous item links directly to a bank vault, making heavy coin pouches a thing of the past. It’s perfect for DMs looking to add immersive banking mechanics and unique magical upgrades to their campaigns.

## Features
- **Secure Wealth Management**: Store gold in a linked vault accessible via the pouch.
- **Weightless Convenience**: Reduce your carrying capacity without sacrificing your treasure.
- **Magical Upgrades**: Add features like password protection, multi-vault access, and more.

## How It Works
The Vaultbound Pouch creates a pocket dimension tied to a specific bank vault. Players can withdraw gold as needed, but deposits require a trip to the bank. If the pouch is damaged, the link is severed until repaired or replaced.
